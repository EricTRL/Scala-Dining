Hi {{ recipient.first_name}}

{{ remover }} has removed your guest {{entry.get_name}} from the following dining list:
Date: {{dining_list.date}}
By: {{dining_list|short_owners_string}}
Association: {{dining_list.association}}

{% if dining_list.is_open and dining_list.has_room %}
If you still want to add your guest to the dining list, you can do that here:
{{ site_uri }}{{ dining_list.get_absolute_url }}
{% endif %}

With kind regards,

The Scala Dining App

You received this e-mail because you originally added {{ entry.get_name }} to the dining list.
